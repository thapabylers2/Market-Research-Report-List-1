<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The XPS Polystyrene Foaming Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Foaming Agent</li><li>Physical Foaming Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The XPS (extruded polystyrene) foaming agent market is dominated by two main types: chemical and physical foaming agents. Chemical foaming agents generate gas through chemical reactions during processing, creating a fine cell structure within the polystyrene, improving insulation properties. In contrast, physical foaming agents utilize gases like carbon dioxide or pentane, injected into the polystyrene to achieve foaming. Both types play critical roles in enhancing the thermal insulation capability and reducing the density of XPS products used in construction and packaging applications.</p></p>
